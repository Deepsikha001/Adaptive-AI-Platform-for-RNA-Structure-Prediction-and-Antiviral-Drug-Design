# Adaptive-AI-Platform-for-RNA-Structure-Prediction-and-Antiviral-Drug-Design

Author: Deepsikha Pramanick  
Affiliation: IIT Guwahati  

## Overview

This project consists of two independent but connected components:

1. RNA 3D Structure Prediction Engine
2. AI-Guided Antiviral Drug Discovery Pipeline

The system enables:
- Theoretical RNA structure prediction
- Viral genome parsing
- Target protein identification
- AI-based small molecule generation
- Docking score evaluation
- Drug-likeness profiling

⚠ This is a theoretical computational pipeline. No biological validation is implied.
